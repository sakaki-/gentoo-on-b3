CONTENTS

COPYING
  GPL 3.0 license text.
README.md
  Brief description of the project, image installation and use.
configs/usb_interstitial_config
  The .config used to build the kernel on the boot partition of the
  USB image; essentially a glorified bootloader, whose job is to run kexec.sh
  (which will load and kexec the 'real' kernel).
configs/b3_interstitial_config
  The .config used to build the kernel shipped in the
  /root/root-on-sda3-kernel directory of the USB image; similar to the above,
  but specifies a different initramfs. (You can grab a tarball of the
  two initramfs from the project releases page on GitHub.)
configs/b3_baseline_config
  The baseline .config used when autobuilding the 'real' kernel zImage
  (for which please see the gentoo-b3-kernel GitHub project, and also its
  corresponding sys-kernel/gentoo-b3-kernel-bin package in the
  gentoo-b3-overlay GitHub project).
configs/b3_stock_config
  The .config from a standard B3, on which the above three were based
  (way back when ^-^).
reference/buildkernel-b3.pdf
  A PDF of the manpage for the buildkernel-b3 utility (which replaces
  the old prep_arm_image<...>.sh scripts)
reference/fstab-on-b3
  The /etc/fstab used when installing to HDD; has boot, swap and root on
  /dev/sda{1,2,3}. /boot is mounted by default now.
reference/fstab-on-live-usb
  The /etc/fstab from the main USB image; has boot, swap and root
  indexed by UUID. /boot is mounted by default now.
reference/genup.pdf
  A PDF of the manpage for the genup utility, which can be used
  to keep your B3 Gentoo system up-to-date easily.
reference/installed-packages
  Full list of installed packages, from eix-installed all; the version numbers
  are Gentoo ebuilds, but they generally map 1-to-1 onto upstream versions
reference/interstitial-init-on-b3
  The init script run from the interstitial (bootloader) kernel when deployed
  onto HDD; the main job of which is to locate and mount the boot partition
  and source the kexec.sh script therein.
reference/interstitial-init-on-live-usb
  Ditto, but used by the intersitital kernel on the live-USB; the
  difference is how the /boot partition is located (here, by UUID).
reference/kexec-on-b3.sh
  The sourced kexec script when booting from HDD. It will load and patch the
  kernel (assumed to be a vanilla zImage), load the DTB, load the initramfs
  (if supplied), then boot the kernel using kexec. Contains an editable kernel
  command line which specifies root as /dev/sda3. No boot delay.
reference/kexec-on-live-usb.sh
  The sourced kexec script when booting from USB. It will load and patch the
  kernel (assumed to be a vanilla zImage), load the DTB, load the initramfs
  (if supplied), then boot the kernel using kexec. Contains an editable kernel
  command line which specifies root by UUID, so it will work even in a
  diskless chassis. 5 seconds boot delay.
reference/kirkwood-b3.dt{b,s}.
  Device tree source (and compiled device tree blob) for the B3, lifted from
  arch/arm/boot/dts/kirkwood-b3.dts in the 4.11.5 kernel source directory;
  this file describes the B3-specific hardware (such as LEDs) to the
  kernel; see the file /etc/init.d/bootled for an example of use.
reference/kirkwood-b3-earlyled.dt{b,s}
  As above, but slightly modified to turn the purple front LED on
  during early boot; used in the current live-USB image to avoid having a
  long gap where the front LED is off, when kexec-ing the 'real' kernel.
reference/porthash.pdf
  A PDF of the manpage for the porthash utility, which allows a signed
  "master" hash of a Portage repo to be created or verified; useful when
  distributing a snapshot via an unauthenticated channel, such as rsync.
reference/setethermac
  The simple boot-time OpenRC service used to ensure that the B3's ethernet
  interfaces have the correct MACs set (because, if the kernel was
  kexec-booted, the MACs will initally both be be 0, and networking will not
  start unless this is corrected).
reference/showem.pdf
  A PDF of the manpage for the showem utility, which allows parallel
  Gentoo emerge runs to be easily monitored.
utils/README
  A short explanation of what has happened to the prep_arm_image.sh
  and prep_arm_image_on_b3.sh scripts (hint - they've been replaced by
  buildkernel-b3).
