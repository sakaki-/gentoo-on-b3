  Brief description of the project, image installation and use
configs/b3_live_usb_config
  The .config used to build the kernel on the boot partition of the
  USB image (assumes you have an internal hard drive in your B3, the
  most usual case); command line set to wait 5 seconds after boot, then
  look for a root on /dev/sdb2
configs/b3_live_usb_diskless_config
  As above, but targeting the case where you have no internal drive in
  your B3 (looks for root on /dev/sda2 instead)
configs/b3_sda3_root_config
  The .config used to build the kernel shipped in the
  /root/root-on-sda3-kernel directory of the USB image
configs/b3_stock_config
  The .config from a standard B3, on which the above two were based
reference/fstab-on-b3
  The /etc/fstab to be used if installing onto the internal drive; has
  boot on /dev/sda1, swap on /dev/sda2, and root on /dev/sda3
reference/fstab-on-live-usb
  The /etc/fstab from the main USB image; has no swap, boot on /dev/sdb1,
  and root on /dev/sdb2
reference/fstab-on-live-usb-diskless
  The /etc/fstab from the diskless USB image; has no swap, 
  boot on /dev/sda1, and root on /dev/sda2
reference/kirkwood-b3.dts
  Device tree description for the B3, lifted from
  arch/arm/boot/dts/kirkwood-b3.dts in the 3.15.9 kernel source directory;
  this file describes the B3-specific hardware (such as LEDs) to the
  kernel; see the file /etc/init.d/bootled for an example of use
utils/prep_arm_image.sh
  Utility script used to build a B3 kernel when cross-compiling on a
  Gentoo PC (executed in the top-level kernel source directory)
utils/prep_arm_image_on_b3.sh
  Utility script used to build a B3 kernel when compiling on the B3
  itself (executed in the top level kernel source directory)
