configs/b3_live_usb_config

  USB image; command line set to wait 5 seconds after boot, then
  look for a root on PARTUUID=05A8FC63-03
configs/b3_sda3_root_config
  The .config used to build the kernel shipped in the
  /root/root-on-sda3-kernel directory of the USB image (looks for a
  root on /dev/sda3, and has no rootdelay)
configs/b3_stock_config
  The .config from a standard B3, on which the above three were based
reference/buildkernel-b3.pdf
  A PDF of the manpage for the buildkernel-b3 utility (which replaces
  the old prep_arm_image<...>.sh scripts)
reference/fstab-on-b3
  The /etc/fstab to be used if installing onto the internal drive; has
  boot on /dev/sda1, swap on /dev/sda2, and root on /dev/sda3
reference/fstab-on-live-usb
  The /etc/fstab from the main USB image; has boot, swap and root
  indexed by UUID
reference/genup-lite.pdf
  A PDF of the manpage for the genup-lite utility, which can be used
  to keep your B3 Gentoo system up-to-date easily
reference/installed-packages
  Full list of installed packages, from eix-installed all; the version numbers
  are Gentoo ebuilds, but they generally map 1-to-1 onto upstream versions
reference/kirkwood-b3.dts
  Device tree description for the B3, lifted from
  arch/arm/boot/dts/kirkwood-b3.dts in the 3.18.6 kernel source directory;
  this file describes the B3-specific hardware (such as LEDs) to the
  kernel; see the file /etc/init.d/bootled for an example of use
reference/kirkwood-b3-live-usb.dts
  As above, but slightly modified to turn the purple front LED on
  during early boot (used in the current live-USB uImage)
reference/showem-lite.pdf
  A PDF of the manpage for the showem-lite utility, which allows parallel
  Gentoo emerge runs to be easily monitored
utils/README
  A short explanation of what has happened to the prep_arm_image.sh
  and prep_arm_image_on_b3.sh scripts (hint - they've been replaced by
  buildkernel-b3)
